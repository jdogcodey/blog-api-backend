# Blog API

Following along with The Odin Project, this is the Blog API. In this project the aim is to make a backend Express server which can access a database and output to two separate front end applications for authentication etc.

Aims for this project:

  Create an Express server that takes in JS requests, authenticates them and then serves them data from a psql db with prisma ORM.


Looking back at this project and the brief on the odin project - it is obvious that I have missed what I was actually meant to do and overcomplicated it now. Rather than scrape together this project into a half-assed attempt at what was requested I am going to move on. I may revisit this in the future but most likely not. 

I am happy with what the backend set up looks like. The routes mostly function as they should and with some finishing adjustments this could and does server the front end. As I say, it isn't to brief - for example the db doesn't really need to have Users, this is an unnecessary overcomplication.
